🔐 CAPTCHA Generator and Verifier using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project implements a simple yet functional CAPTCHA system to distinguish between human users and bots using front-end web technologies only—no backend required. The CAPTCHA is generated dynamically using JavaScript, displayed in a visually obfuscated format, and requires the user to correctly input the characters to proceed.

🛠️ Features:
Random CAPTCHA Generation: A random combination of letters and numbers is generated on page load or upon user request (refresh).

Basic Obfuscation: Uses skewed, rotated, and colorful text to make automated reading difficult.

User Input Verification: Validates the user's input against the generated CAPTCHA.

Feedback System: Provides success or error messages based on validation.

Pure Frontend: Built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—no external libraries or backend.

🔧 Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the input form and CAPTCHA display area.

CSS: For styling the CAPTCHA box, feedback messages, and adding basic distortion to characters.

JavaScript: For generating the CAPTCHA, validating user input, and refreshing the CAPTCHA.
